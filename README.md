# Retain

It's a note/checklist app. Heavily inspired by Google Keep, except it's not evil (i.e. open source, doesn't track you). You can sync your notes to a Nextcloud, SFTP, or Dropbox account if you so desire.

Not yet available on any appstores etc. But it will probably come. Don't get your knickers in a twist!
